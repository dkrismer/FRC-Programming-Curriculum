# Lesson 1

THIS IS JUST A ROUGH OUTLINE.

The goal of this lesson is to use VS Code and its automated code
generation tool to create a new robot project, add our own custom
code, build that program, and deploy it to a robot!

Don't worry if you can't code (yet). This exercises is about getting
familiar with the tools you'll be using.

# Building a Test Project

- open VS CODE
- navigate to create new project
- fill in details for drive train
- build code
- fix any problems
- deploy code to robot (in class)

# In Class

- discuss the parts of the robot

# Pic a Directory for Keeping your Code

On the PC clone files into your Documents/GitHub directory. Having a
common directory for all your GitHub repos is a good idea. You want to
be able to find them again quickly, so placing your "GitHub" directy
in a directory that shows up in sidebar of your PC's File Explorer (or
Finder on the Mac) will save you hunting around later.
 

# Create Your First Robot Program

 1. make a new directory in your GitHub directory for your code. Call it
    Documents/GitHub/MyFirstRobot for instance
 2. run VS Code
 3. instructions for code generation
 4. instructions for adding drive code, arcade drive & motor ids 
 5. instructinos for building the code
 6. deploy, deploy, deploy!
 7. drive the robot

# Getting a Copy of the Team's Robot Code

Next is to download the team's current robot code and building that.

## Clone the repo. 

### Command line:

 cd ~/Documents/Github
 git clone https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/FRC-2019-Public.git

### Use the GitHub Desktop tool

put instructions here w/ screen shots

# Build the Robot Code
