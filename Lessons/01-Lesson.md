# Lesson 1

THIS IS JUST A ROUGH OUTLINE.

The goal of this lesson is to use VS Code and its automated code
generation tool to create a new robot project, add our own custom
code, build that program, and deploy it to a robot!

Don't worry if you can't code (yet). This exercises is about getting
familiar with the tools you'll be using.

# Building a Test Project

- open VS CODE
- navigate to create new project
- fill in details for drive train
- build code
- fix any problems
- deploy code to robot (in class)

# Resources

- YouTube tutorials
- online documentation (screenstepslive.com)

# In Class

- discuss the parts of the robot

# Getting a Copy of the Robot Code

Next is to download the team's current robot code and building that.

Clone the repo.
