# Lesson 1

The goal of this lesson is to use VS Code and its automated code
generation tool to create a new robot project, add our own custom
code, build that program, and deploy it to a robot!

You will also publish this code to your GitHub account.

Don't worry if you can't code (yet). This exercises is about getting
familiar with the tools you'll be using.

## Building a Test Project

1. open VS CODE. 

If you used the PC installer, it should have a shortcut link on the desktop.

2. press Control-Shift-P (or it may be Command-Shift-P on a Mac) This will open the Command Palette. 

![VS Code Command Palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/randomstring/FRC-Programming-Curriculum/master/Lessons/imgs/Command_Palette.png)

This is a text window where you can execute commands to build code, update vendor libraries, set your team number, change the the JAVA library path, and many other tasks. Most of the time it's easier to just click on menu, files, and icons, but sometimes the command palette is the easiest way and sometimes the only way to run certain commands.

3. In the Command Palette, type "WPILib: Create a new project" and hit return.
   The command Palette will try to autocomplete and guess what command. So you can just type "new project" for instance and then select "WPILib: Create a new project" from the list of suggestions.
- fill in details of the 


- build code, there shouldn't be any errors yet.

  image about where to look for errors

- push code to github
  - git init
  - create repo on github.com
  - add


- add changes for your robot: motor ids
- build code, fix any problems?
- deploy code to robot (in class)

# In Class

- discuss the parts of the robot

# Pick a Directory for Keeping your Code

On the PC clone files into your Documents/GitHub directory. Having a
common directory for all your GitHub repos is a good idea. You want to
be able to find them again quickly, so placing your "GitHub" directy
in a directory that shows up in sidebar of your PC's File Explorer (or
Finder on the Mac) will save you hunting around later.
 

# Create Your First Robot Program

 1. make a new directory in your GitHub directory for your code. Call it
    Documents/GitHub/MyFirstRobot for instance
 2. run VS Code
 3. instructions for code generation
 4. instructions for adding drive code, arcade drive & motor ids 
 5. instructinos for building the code
 6. deploy, deploy, deploy!
 7. drive the robot

# Getting a Copy of the Team's Robot Code

Next is to download the team's current robot code and building that.

## Clone the repo. 

### Command line:

 cd ~/Documents/Github
 git clone https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/FRC-2019-Public.git

### Use the GitHub Desktop tool

put instructions here w/ screen shots

# Build the Robot Code
