# Homework Lesson 1<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

The goal of this homework assignment is to have a working development
environment so you can write code and run it on a FRC robot.

1.  Account setup
    
    Our team uses several different services to store and track changes
    in our code and to communicate with our fellow programmers.
    
    1.  [Github](<https://github.com/>) to store our code, track changes,
        and collaborate
    2.  [Slack](<https://slack.com/>) is a chat service used by our team,
        we have a #programming channel for sharing programming
        announcements, discussion, and asking for help. Our team also uses
        Slack to communicate during events and competitions.
    
    Start by going to <https://github.com/join> and creating an
    account. When choosing an account name and avatar, keep in mind
    your github account will be visible to all. Github is also a good
    way to share your work with others and can act as a coding
    resume. Next email your GitHub username to your programming lead
    and/or mentor so they can grant you access to your team's Github
    repositories (that's what Github calls a project folder).  Next is
    joining Slack and the #programming sub-channel. The easiest way to
    do this is to email the team (sonicsquirrels@gmail.com) and ask to
    be added. Make sure you include your name and email in the message
    so the admin knows who you are.
    
    If you already have a Slack account and are on the Team Slack
    work space <https://sonicsquirrels.slack.com/> then add yourself to the
    programming channel by sending the slack message "/join
    \\#programming". 
    
    Slack has a desktop app and also native apps for the iPhone and
    Android.
    
    While you're waiting to get added to the team's accounts, take a
    moment to browse your team's code on Github. Team 2930's code
    resides at <https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/> and last year's
    robot code is at
    <https://github.com/FRC-Sonic-Squirrels/FRC-2019-Public>
    
    If you're on a different team, try Googling "FRC <your team number>
    github.com"

1.  Software Installation Requirements
    
    Next we need to setup the development environment on your
      computer. This is a set of tools for editing, building, testing,
      and deploying code. The software is all free. The tools we will
      install are:
    
    1.  VS Code, this is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that
        is a file editor with added intelligence that understands the code
        you write and helps automates much of the process of editing,
        debugging, and running programs.
    2.  FIRST supplied tools. These include programs for generating robot
        codes using and interactive GUI (Graphical User Interface), a
        robot path planner, and Shuffleboard a tool for monitoring what's
        happening on the robot.
    3.  GitHub desktop. This is a GUI for working with code stored on
        github.com. Most of your interactions with GitHub will be handled
        by VS Code and this installs the programs VS Code will use behind
        the scenes.
    
    To install the software you'll need a computer. Pretty much any PC,
      Mac, or Linux will work. Ideally a laptop you can bring to
      programming meetings. Almost any laptop, even very old and slow
      ones, will work. The team has a few laptops that can be shared. The
      team can help you setup an old cast off laptop.
    
    Your laptop will need WiFi in order to connect to the school network
      and also to connect to the robot. A USB 2.0/3.0 port is useful for
      hardwired connections to the robot. Having an Ethernet port, or
      USB-to-Ethernet adapter, is a nice to have but not necessary.

2.  Software Installation
    
    Follow the instructions outlined here. Note, the main instruction is
      to follow the link to wpilib.screenstepslive.com and follow the
      detailed instructions there.
    
    <https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases>
    
    You start by downloading the appropriate software bundle for your
      computer and operating system. To do this scroll down to the
      section of the page that looks like this:

[[![img](./imgs/Download_Links.jpg "Download links look like this.")]]

Here is a direct link to the detailed instructions from screenstepslive.com:
<https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/getting_started/l/999999-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc>

Then install the GitHub desktop software:

<https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop>

-   URL instruction, just follow directions
-   hints on which bundles you want to download
-   warnings about potential problems
    -   don't wait to download at school, network is slow
    -   installing Java
-   reminder to ask for help

1.  Advanced Topics
    
    If you don't have a laptop you can try to install all the software
      onto a portable thumb drive or some other type of portable
      media. This will let you carry your entire programming environment
      with you. You just need to borrow a computer with the same
      operating system and run VS Code directly from your thumb drive. The
      school has sets of classroom laptops we could use for this purpose.
    
    WARNING: We haven't actually tried this yet!
