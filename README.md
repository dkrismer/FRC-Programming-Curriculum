# FRC-Programming-Curriculum
An effort to outline a curriculum and resources for learning programming FRC robots.

## 0. Outline

Starting this repository to organize my thoughts on what needs subjects need to be covered for someone to become competent at programming FRC robots. There is a lot of ground to cover to go from not programming to programming FRC robots. 

I started volunteering with FIRST as a programming mentor in 2018. As a someone with 35 years of programming experience, programming robots was completely novel.  The learning curve was very steap and I approached learning this like I would learning any new technology for the job. I took a course controlling mobile robots. Trying to sort throught the overwhelming haystack of FRC programming resources, some out of date, many incomplete, and all scattered across many websites.

Here, my goal is to organize where the good, accurate, and well strutured FRC programming resources are. I also hope to outline a curriculum that will take a student with little to no programming experience and give them a path to programming complex robot behaviors. Along the way, outlining general computer science principles and good programming and engineering practices. 


## 1. Lesson Plan

Crash course to get students to the point that they can write, build, deploy, run, and debug robot code. 

## 2. Slides

Next up, start creating a curriculum, slides, notes, and a leason plan for instruction.

## 3. Examples

Example robot programs. Have students clone a repo, complete the missing code segments, build the code, and test thier robot. 

### Modified Command Based Robot Template
### Command Based Robot w/ Arcade Drive
### One motor & encoder subsystem with a PID tunable task
### Display values to SmartDashboard for debugging
### NetworkTables to have editable variables (PID tuning)
